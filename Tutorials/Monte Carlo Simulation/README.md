# Monte Carlo Simulaation
 
Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.

We use the Monte Carlo method when a problem is too complex and difficult to do by direct calculation. 
Using the simulation can help provide solutions for situations that prove uncertain. 
A large number of iterations allows a simulation of the normal distribution.

### Example Steps to Monte Carlo
To prepare the Monte Carlo simulation, you need 5,000 results.

**Step 1:** Dice Rolling Events. First, we develop a range of data with the results of each of the three dice for 50 rolls. ...

**Step 2:** Range of Outcomes. ...

**Step 3:** Conclusions. ...

**Step 4:** Number of Dice Rolls. ...

**Step 5:** Simulation. ...

**Step 6:** Probability.
