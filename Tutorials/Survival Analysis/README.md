# Survival Analysis

Survival Analysis is used to estimate the lifespan of a particular population under study. It is also called ‘Time to Event’ Analysis as the goal is to estimate the time for an individual or a group of individuals to experience an event of interest. 

Survival Analysis was originally developed and used by Medical Researchers and Data Analysts to measure the lifetimes of a certain population. But, over the years, it has been used in various other applications such as predicting churning customers/employees, estimation of the lifetime of a Machine, etc. 

The birth event can be thought of as the time of a customer starts their membership with a company, and the death event can be considered as the customer leaving the company.
