# Bernoulli Distribution
 
The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that covers a case where an event will have a binary outcome as either a 0 or 1.

A “Bernoulli trial” is an experiment or case where the outcome follows a Bernoulli distribution. The distribution and the trial are named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli.

Some common examples of Bernoulli trials include:

1. The single flip of a coin that may have a heads (0) or a tails (1) outcome.
2. A single birth of either a boy (0) or a girl (1).
